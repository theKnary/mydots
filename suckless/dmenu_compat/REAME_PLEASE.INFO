This is just a unpatched version of dmenu. I use this with surf only. The other
dmenu is used for general purposes.

***

* This is handled by the normal dmenu make file *

I achieve this by:

installing this build first,

renaming the binary from dmenu to dmenu_comp in /usr/local/bin,

changing the surf config file to call dmenu_comp instead of dmenu,

and then finally installing my general purpose build of dmenu.
